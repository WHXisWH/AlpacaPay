# AI-Powered Payment Execution dApp

## What is this dApp?

This is a blockchain payment application that focuses on **executing transactions** while solving the "gas token problem" through AI analysis. The core functionality is **making payments on NERO Chain** with a built-in AI component that helps optimize the gas payment process.

## Primary Functions

1. **Transaction Execution**
   - Send tokens to any address
   - Execute smart contract calls
   - Process payments using Account Abstraction

2. **Flexible Gas Payment**
   - Pay transaction fees with any supported ERC20 token
   - No need to hold native NERO tokens
   - Support for three payment types: sponsored, prepay, postpay

3. **AI-Powered Optimization**
   - Analyze available tokens to find the most cost-effective option
   - Consider balance, volatility, and liquidity factors
   - Provide one-click recommendation for simplest user experience

## How It Works

![User Flow Diagram](./docs/userflow.png)

1. **User initiates a payment**
   - Connect wallet
   - Enter recipient and amount
   - Select transaction details

2. **AI analyzes token options**
   - Examines all tokens in the wallet
   - Scores each based on our algorithm
   - Identifies the most cost-efficient token

3. **System executes the transaction**
   - Creates a UserOperation
   - Configures Paymaster for gas payment
   - Sends to NERO Chain for processing
   - Returns confirmation to the user

## Technical Implementation

The application consists of:

- **React frontend** for transaction interface
- **Node.js backend** for AI processing and token analysis
- **NERO Chain integration** using Account Abstraction and Paymaster

## Value Proposition

This dApp delivers value by:

1. **Simplifying Web3 payments** - Execute blockchain transactions without managing gas tokens
2. **Reducing cognitive load** - AI makes complex decisions about gas optimization
3. **Improving user experience** - One-click execution with flexible payment options
4. **Lowering transaction costs** - Intelligent selection of the most cost-effective token

## Target Users

- Web3 users who want a simpler payment experience
- DeFi users who hold multiple tokens
- Businesses accepting crypto payments
- New users transitioning from Web2 to Web3

## Differentiator

While other dApps may offer Account Abstraction or token swapping, our application uniquely combines:

1. Direct payment execution
2. AI-driven token optimization
3. NERO Chain's flexible gas payment system

This creates a Web2-like payment experience with the benefits of blockchain technology.
